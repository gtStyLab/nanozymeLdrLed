## Overview
C++ code for manuscript "Copper nanocubes as low-cost enzyme mimics in a sarcosine-sensing reaction cascade"   

Authors: Anuja Tripathi, Mark P. Styczynski

## Description
This file was used with an Arduino system with a microcontroller, four 10K ohm resistors, four 5V light emitting diodes (LEDs), and a light-dependent resistor (LDR). The file should be compiled and loaded in Arduino IDE. Once loaded, the LDR will detect varying light intensities from different sarcosine concentrations in solution and activate the corresponding LED based on the detected light intensity.
